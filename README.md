## 🎯 Project Overview

This project is a hands-on network analysis lab using **Nmap** and **Wireshark**.

The purpose is to understand how network discovery and scanning work, then compare the results of Nmap with the actual network traffic captured in Wireshark.

The project focuses on:

* Network discovery
* Port scanning
* Service detection
* Packet capture
* Traffic analysis
* Comparing tool output with packet-level evidence
* Technical documentation

The work was completed in an isolated virtual lab environment.

## 🖥️ Lab Environment

| Component                     | Details                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 🐧 Attacker / Analysis System | Kali Linux               |
| 🪟 Target System              | Windows 11               |
| 💻 Virtualization             | UTM                      |
| 🌐 Network                    | Isolated virtual network |
| 🔍 Scanning Tool              | Nmap                     |
| 📡 Packet Analysis            | Wireshark                |

### 🌐 Network Configuration

The lab uses a direct virtual network between Kali Linux and Windows 11.

The current lab addressing is:

| System        | IP Address       |Role       |
| ------------- | ---------------- |---------------- |
| 🐧 Kali Linux | `192.168.128.3` |Analysis/ Scanning| 
| 🪟 Windows 11 | `192.168.128.4` |Target |

The environment is intended only for controlled testing between the two lab systems.

## 🏗️ Baseline & Network Topology

Before running the experiments, the network configuration and connectivity between Kali Linux and Windows 11 were verified.

Baseline evidence includes:

1. UTM network configuration
2. Kali Linux network configuration and connectivity
3. Windows 11 network configuration and connectivity
4. Windows 11 listening ports
5. Final lab network topology

# 🔬 Experiments

The project is divided into three progressive experiments.

## 01 — Basic Host Discovery

The first experiment focuses on identifying an active host on the lab network.

**Objective:**

* Discover the target system
* Confirm network reachability
* Observe the traffic generated during discovery

📁 **Experiment:**
[`experiments/01-basic-host-discovery/`](experiments/01-basic-host-discovery/)

---

## 02 — Port Scanning

The second experiment examines the ports exposed by the Windows 11 target.

**Objective:**

* Identify open ports
* Understand the purpose of port scanning
* Capture and examine the related network traffic

📁 **Experiment:**
[`experiments/02-port-scanning/`](experiments/02-port-scanning/)

---

## 03 — Service Detection

The third experiment builds on port scanning by examining the services associated with discovered ports.

**Objective:**

* Identify services running on discovered ports
* Compare Nmap results with captured traffic
* Understand how service detection generates network activity

📁 **Experiment:**
[`experiments/03-service-detection/`](experiments/03-service-detection/)

# 📡 Nmap + Wireshark Analysis

A key part of this project is comparing two different views of the same network activity:

```text
Nmap
  ↓
Scan / Discovery
  ↓
Network Traffic
  ↓
Wireshark Capture
  ↓
Packet Analysis
  ↓
Compare Results
```

**Nmap** provides the scan results.

**Wireshark** provides packet-level visibility into the traffic generated during the scan.

Using both tools provides a better understanding of what happens on the network instead of relying only on the final Nmap output.

# 🤝 Collaboration

The project was completed using **individual lab environments**.

The three participants are:

* 👨‍💻 [Hari Krishnan R K](https://github.com/harikrishnan-rk)
* 👨‍💻 [Manu P Nair](https://github.com/manunair16)
* 👨‍💻 [Varun M Nair](https://github.com/varunmnair95)

Each participant maintains a separate repository and lab setup.

Collaboration may include:

* Sharing approaches
* Discussing observations
* Comparing results
* Reviewing documentation

The implementation and evidence in this repository represent **my own lab work**.

---

# 📸 Evidence

The repository contains screenshots and supporting evidence for the lab setup and experiments.

Evidence is used to show:

* Network configuration
* Connectivity
* Target listening ports
* Nmap activity
* Wireshark packet captures
* Experiment observations

The intention is to document the actual work performed rather than only describe the theory.
